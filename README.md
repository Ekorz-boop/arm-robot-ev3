# PA1473 - Software Development: Agile Project (Template)

## Template information
This template should help your team write a good readme-file for your project. (The file is called README.md in your project directory.)
You are of course free to add more sections to your readme if you want to.

Readme-files on GitHub are formatted using Markdown. You can find information about how to format using Markdown here: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax

Your readme-file should include the following sections:


## Introduction

This part should give a general introduction to your project.

This project is a University project where a lego mindstorms robot (ev3) is supposed to be programmed with different user stories in mind. 
The main objective/feature of the project is to enable the robot arm to sort lego bricks according to different criterias. 


## Getting started
* Clone the project folder to your computer using git bash ("git clone https://github.com/Ekorz-boop/arm-robot-ev3") in a destination of your choice

* Make sure you have ev3dev-browser, Lego Mindstorms EV3 Microython, Python and Flake8 (optional but recommended) installed. You can install these in the extensions
tab in visual studio code. 

* Open the folder in visual studio code and sync your instance to the repository using ("git pull") in the folder via git bash or via the source control tab in visual studio code.

* Now you have the latest version and can make changes, commit and push via the visual studio code source control tab for convenience.


## Building and running

This is where you explain how to make the project run. What is your startup procedure? Does the program accept different arguments to do different things?

You should also describe how to operate your program. Does it need manual input before it starts picking up and sorting the items?

To run the program you first need a ev3 mindstorms robot and all dependencies installed. Then follow these steps:

## Features
- [DONE] US_1:  As a customer, I want the robot to pick up items
- [DONE] US_1B: As a customer, I want the robot to pick up items from a designated position
- [DONE] US_2: As a customer, I want the robot to drop off items
- [DONE] US_2B: As a customer, I want the robot to drop items off at a designated position.
- [DONE] US_3: As a customer, I want the robot to be able to determine if an item is present at a given location.
- [DONE] US_4: As a customer, I want the robot to tell me the color of an item.
- [DONE] US_5: As a customer, I want the robot to drop items off at different locations based on the color of the item.
- [DONE] US_6: As a customer, I want the robot to be able to pick up items from elevated positions
- [DONE] US_8: As a customer, I want to be able to calibrate maximum of three different colors and assign them to specific drop-off zones.
- [DONE] US_8B: As a customer, I want to be able to calibrate items with three different colors and drop the items off at specific drop-off zones based on color
- [DONE] US_9: As a customer, I want the robot to check the pickup location periodically to see if a new item has arrived.
- [DONE] US_10: As a customer, I want the robots to sort items at a specific time. 
- [ ] US_11: As a customer, I want two robots to communicate and work together on items sorting without colliding with each other.
- [DONE] US_12: As a customer, I want to be able to manually set the locations and heights of one pick-up zone and two drop-off zones. (Implemented either by manually dragging the arm to a position or using buttons).
