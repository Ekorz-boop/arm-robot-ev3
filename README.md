# PA1473 - Software Development: Agile Project (Template)

## Template information
This template should help your team write a good readme-file for your project. (The file is called README.md in your project directory.)
You are of course free to add more sections to your readme if you want to.

Readme-files on GitHub are formatted using Markdown. You can find information about how to format using Markdown here: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax

Your readme-file should include the following sections:


## Introduction

This part should give a general introduction to your project.

This project is a University project where a lego mindstorms robot (ev3) is supposed to be programmed with different user stories in mind. 
The main objective/feature of the project is to enable the robot arm to sort lego bricks according to different criterias. 


## Getting started

This section is supposed to guide a new developer through the steps of how to set up the project and install the deppendencies they need to start developing.
* Clone the project folder to your computer using git bash ("git clone https://github.com/Ekorz-boop/arm-robot-ev3") in a destination of your choice

* Make sure you have ev3dev-browser, Lego Mindstorms EV3 Microython, Python and Flake8 (optional but recommended) installed. You can install these in the extensions
tab in visual studio code. 

* Open the folder in visual studio code and sync your instance to the repository using ("git pull") in the folder via git bash or via the source control tab in visual studio code.

* Now you have the latest version and can make changes, commit and push via the visual studio code source control tab for convenience.


## Building and running

This is where you explain how to make the project run. What is your startup procedure? Does the program accept different arguments to do different things?

You should also describe how to operate your program. Does it need manual input before it starts picking up and sorting the items?

To run the program you first need a ev3 mindstorms robot and all dependencies installed. Then follow these steps:

* 


## Features

Lastly, you should write which of the user stories you did and didn't develop in this project, in the form of a checklist. Like this:

- [x] US_1: As a user I want to...
- [ ] US_2: As a user I want to...
